# guest-guide
Website for EJ's Airbnb listing

**TODO**: Link QR code with GitHub Pages URL, print out QR code for guests  

## Host Quick Start (Non-Technical)

### The only thing the host needs:
- The QR code printed in the house
- The hosted website link (GitHub Pages URL)

If content needs updating:
- Casey (or EJ with 'git clone <repo>') updates the site and redeploys
- The QR code can stay the same as long as the URL stays the same

## Developer Setup (Local Testing)

### Requirements
- Node.js (LTS recommended)

### Install & run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Important:** The host does not “run” the app. It runs automatically on the internet (GitHub Pages).
